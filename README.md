# WDI Project 1 - Simon

Project Link: Coming Soon!

## Overview

This is what I developed for the first project in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive.  I chose to do the Simon project because I felt I had some basic ideas on how I could put it together but knew it would challenge me at the same time.

## Technologies Used

* Languages - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* Mockups - Balsamiq
* Project Planning & User Stories - Trello
* Text Editor - Sublime Text 3

## Features

* In Progress

## Build Process

### Mockups and Features

I created a mockup based around the basic features that I will implement in this project.  I've also created a mockup showing "bonus" features that I'd like to implement given time.

I decided to approach this build with a "mobile-first" mindset.  I've read about the benefits of this mindset, and thought it might help me focus on creating a smooth, functional, small-scale product that I could (ideally) expand for larger screens without too much hassle. I created two mobile mockups showing what the final product might look like on smaller and larger mobile devices in both portrait and landscape.  I look forward to seeing how this approach turns out.

#### Basic Implemented Features:

* Buttons light up (change color) as the sequence is given to the player, and as the player presses the buttons in response.
* Each button makes a unique sound as the sequence is given and as the player presses the buttons.
* A special sound plays when the user makes a mistake.
* Score is kept as the player's correct sequence gets longer.

#### Future Development:

* Store and display the player's longest successful sequence.
  - This would ideally be stored through browser refreshes and resets.
* Give player the ability to choose between "Easy", "Medium", and "Hard" difficulties.
  - This will affect the speed at which the player is given the pattern.
* Add the ability to play with corresponding keyboard keys rather than clicking.
  - Possible key bindings:

    | In-game button | Keyboard Key  |
    | -------------- | ------------- |
    | Start          | Enter         |
    | Green          | Q             |
    | Red            | R             |
    | Blue           | B             |
    | Yellow         | Z             |

* Recreate Simon's audio/visual pattern played when the game is turned on.
